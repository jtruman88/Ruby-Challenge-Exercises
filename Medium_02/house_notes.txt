The first line of the rhyme is the last line in the array.

This line will be the first line in the first paragraph.

After that, it will be the last line of each paragraph.

Each new paragraph will add a new line.

The new line in each paragraph will be printed before the lines in the previous paragraph.

Each line in the array has two parts.

The first part of each line will be the start of the first line in a new paragraph, preceded by "This is "

The second part of each line if the array will precede the next line in the paragraph.

---

Store the first line in its own variable "first_line".

Store the beginning of each paragraph in a variable - beginning = "This is "

Initialize "rhyme" array to hold the paragraphs

Loop through "until" lines.empty?.

Initialize "current" variable. Add "#{beginning} " to "current".

Nest in the loop and iterate through the "lines" array with "each" with "line" as main line and "line_start" as next lines start.

Add "#{line}\n#{line_start} " to "current"

After "each" block is finished add "line_one" to "current".

Then "rhyme.unshift(current)".

Then "lines.shift"
